                Going through this eventful journey from requirement gathering to solution designing has taught me
                various lessons and enhanced my views and modus operandi. It has taught me insightful lessons such as:
                how to ask good questions through the “mum test”, handling conflicts during ideation by integrating
                them, how everybody has different mental models and the risks, benefits and how’s of aligning our mental
                models, the importance of integrating user feedback into our design process and many more lessons among
                those.
              </p>
              <div class="expanded-content" style="display: none;">
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  One memorable learning experience was when I was heavily involved with the ideation and prototyping
                  process of this project. After finishing my segment, I simply handed over to the person in charge of
                  the next step of the project and took my hands off of it. However, due to my negligence, the intended
                  solution started diverging from the intended solution.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  To remedy this, the team realigned our views of the solution by consolidating our diverging views onto
                  a thinking model for a shared mental model throughout the team. This experience taught me the valuable
                  lesson of keeping my involvement to ensure that my team members are on the same page and pursue a
                  unified solution. The stages involved in designing a solution should not be silo but a constant
                  collaborative journey.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  This project has taught me numerous valuable lessons that will stick with me and shape how I approach
                  future collaborative work. I’ve learnt that good design isn’t just about having strong individual
                  ideas but also co-creating with others, aligning perspectives, and continuously validating assumptions
                  with real users. Moving forward, I’ll be more intentional about maintaining open communication across
                  stages, staying engaged beyond my assigned tasks, and embracing tension and feedback as opportunities

                Over the course of this project, I had the opportunity to work on every aspects of the project, from the
                ideation phase all the way to the final documentation of the proposed solution. I would say the journey
                had been interesting and fulfilling with many ups and downs.
              </p>
              <div class="expanded-content" style="display: none;">
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The journey started at the ideation and problem statement clarification. At that stage, we were trying
                  to figure out the details of the problem, gain context knowledge as well as brainstorm some potential
                  ideas and solutions. This ideation phase was filled with back and forth conversation, clarifying each
                  other’s understanding of the problem as well as the objective that we are specifically trying to
                  solve. Throwing ideas around helped us find the best features that will solve the pain points of the
                  problem. Looking back, I personally think that the mood of the discussion was the most important
                  aspect. The right mood among my team members allowed everyone to contribute their thoughts and ideas
                  freely without repercussions or judgments. The final solution was a combination of everyone’s inputs
                  and apprehension, which fully satisfy the objective we laid out at the start of the ideation process.
                  Therefore, I am glad that we, as a group, jelled well together and maintained a professional yet
                  friendly atmosphere within the group, striving to reach the best idea possible.

                  The next major phase is the prototyping phase, which involves iterating through the prototype as it
                  goes from lo-fi, mid-fi and high-fi. As it iterates, the word journey fits it really well. The process
                  feels like a journey where it progressively builds on the past work, taking in different kind of
                  feedback along the way in order to become a final prototype that reflects the final product. My
                  takeaway is exactly that it was more of a journey than anything else and should be seen as 1 whole
                  process. One of the key event during this process was that we tried to hasten the process by doing the
                  mid-fi and high-fi simultaneously, skipping user feedback and proceeding with what we think was right.
                  This came to haunt us as we realised that we missed many issues that could have been identified during
                  the mid-fi stage. We learnt that there are no shortcut on the road to quality. I used to see
                  prototyping as 3 different phases but after this experience, I see them as a long process that build
                  ontop of each other to reach a quality product at the end.

                Working on the Figma prototype for the species identification website was a valuable exercise in both
                design precision and empathy. I had to pay close attention to detail,not just in terms of layout,
                colors, and consistency, but also in how the interface would actually be used by real experts in the
                field. The experts had an important task on verifying several species types in sometimes subtle visual
                differences in photos, so it was crucial to provide a seamless and smooth experience.

                  Designing for that kind of workflow meant stepping into their shoes and imagining what would make
                  their job easier and more efficient. I had to think about how images are displayed, how information is
                  prioritized, and how easy it is to compare, tag, or reject submissions. The goal was to reduce
                  cognitive load and friction in the process, without sacrificing clarity or scientific accuracy. It
                  challenged me to design not just something that looked good, but something that supports critical,
                  detail-oriented work.

                Designing the Figma prototype for the species identification website pushed me to think deeply about
                creating a visually appealing, seamless, and intuitive user experience. Throughout the design process, I
                found myself constantly evaluating decisions against Nielsen's usability heuristics, particularly
                focusing on how each choice would impact the mental workload of researchers engaged in
                detailed-oriented, repetitive identification tasks.
              </p>
              <div class="expanded-content" style="display: none;">
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  I became increasingly aware of how much small, thoughtful choices matter. For example, emphasis on
                  consistency in spacing, type hierarchy, and color usage to ensure a clean visual rhythm. Rather than
                  drawing attention to the design itself, I aimed to let the content and the task at hand stay front and
                  center. It was a balance of form and function, where aesthetics serve usability. Seeing the pieces
                  slowly but surely come together in a way that feels natural and smooth was definitely one of the most
                  satisfying parts of the process.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Moreover, another complex challenge I faced was designing for such a varied group of users, not just
                  because of their varying levels of expertise, but because each group accessed the system through
                  different entry points and needed different functionalities. This pushed me to think very critically
                  about user journeys. This meant that I had to put myself in the various users’ shoes and gain insights
                  on their expectations as well as their pain points, which the interviews and discussions conducted
                  helped tremendously. It definitely was a little frustrating having to go through countless iterations
                  to align with what the entire team wanted but the innate passion to solve the problem deeply motivated
                  me. I wanted to create tailored and curated experiences that also felt cohesive across the entire
                  platform. I tried to maintain consistency in core design elements, while also allowing flexibility in
                  layout and functionality depending on who was accessing the page. This experience gave me a much
                  clearer appreciation of the “flexibility and efficiency of use” heuristic, and how it can be
                  implemented through adaptive design.

                One strength we recognised was our team’s willingness to adapt, especially when we didn’t initially
                agree on a particular approach. Whilst the team was in the process of creating the prototype, we had
                differing views on the layout of the page where the expert would verify the identification of the
                species.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Initially, our layout did not account for the expert to “disagree” with the prediction of the model.
                  One of our team members pointed out this concern, leading on a discussion on whether or not to include
                  a separate disagree button for the AI model prediction, and the justification for each. While
                  maintaining a single button would be simpler, and the disagree button would rely on the iNaturalist’s
                  identification and train the model in the background, having a separate button would allow the expert
                  to provide direct feedback to our model.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  We opted to have separate disagree buttons for the model and
                  iNaturalist, as it improved the clarity and functionality of the expert input process. As such, with
                  this, even though we had disagreements, we weighed different perspectives and decided on the option
                  that gave the most value.

                  During the early prototyping stages, we lacked user and team feedback. After completing our
                  low-fidelity (Lo-Fi) prototype, we did not gather any feedback for our design, and moved straight into
                  developing the mid-fidelity (Mid-Fi) prototype. The same problem continued with the Mid-Fi prototype,
                  with us not consulting users or prompting any discussion within our team on any potential

                  prototype, which led to a series of delays and difficult changes due to the time-consuming and complex
                  nature of Hi-Fi prototype revision. This could have been avoided had we sought user feedback in all

                The initial disconnect came from the use of iNaturalist within our solution. Team members were not
                sure if our partner needed an app like iNaturalist or to integrate iNaturalist into the solution. This
                was one of many confusions about the premise of the problem. Due to the open-ended nature of the
                problem statement that lacked specific constraints, there were a broad range of interpretations about
                the premise and context of the problem. There were many questions that we wanted to ask, but we were
                unsure if our questions were able to target all the different user needs and perspectives. We learnt
                that when tackling an open-ended problem, there are too many viewpoints to take into consideration and
                we needed a way to consolidate them.

                To fix this, we used the AEIOU method to systematically map out our thoughts and created a shared
                mental model. It allowed us to consider things from the point of view of: activities, environment
                interactions, objects and users, which gave us a comprehensive overview of gaps in our questions. This
                allowed the questions we crafted to have a more holistic view to uncover various users and their
                needs. We learnt the importance of having a shared mental model within our group to align our goals
                and the importance of charting the different viewpoints involved with the problem.

                One particularly memorable session involved shadowing an expert botanist during their routine survey

                Observing their workflow, noting patterns, and understanding the cognitive load involved in species
                identification completely reshaped our approach to interface design. We realized our initial designs
                were far too complex for field use.

                The interviews also revealed the emotional aspects of citizen science participation. Users weren't
                just
                interested in data collection; they wanted to feel part of a larger conservation effort. This insight
                led us to incorporate progress indicators and community engagement features that made users feel their

              During our ideation phase, there was a divide within our group about the use of AI to automate the
              process
              as opposed to a human expert identifier. Our partner in the project made it clear that while AI can be
              helpful, it may be unreliable and so she discourages the use of it. This brought to light two opposing
              perspectives: one advocating for AI-led identification to leverage speed and scalability, and the other
              emphasizing the importance of expert judgement to ensure accuracy and trustworthiness. This clash of
              ideas
              forced us to grapple with the limitations and strengths of both approaches, having to choose one or the
              other.

              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                To move forward, we applied integrative thinking. Rather than choosing one side, we faced the tension
                of
                opposing ideas to generate a creative solution that contains elements of the opposing ideas but is
                superior to simply using one. We identified the pros of each idea and identified the central tension
                of
                “How can we use both AI and human expertise without compromising reliability or efficiency?”

              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Our breakthrough came when we proposed a system where the AI suggests a species, but the expert makes
                the final call. This approach allowed us to retain the reliability of the expert, while still
                benefiting
                from AI’s speed and consistency. By embracing the tension instead of avoiding it, we created a more
                resilient and well-rounded solution.

              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                This experience taught us several important lessons. First, conflicting ideas are not roadblocks but
                opportunities for creative resolution. Disagreements can lead to stronger, more innovative outcomes
                when
                explored thoughtfully. Second, decision-making models such as integrative thinking help push us beyond
                surface-level comparisons. They encourage deeper analysis and structured reasoning, which ultimately
                guided our team to a consensus. Lastly, we learnt that limitations like AI’s occasional inaccuracy can
                be reframed as creative constraints that drive better design. In our case, AI’s weakness of
                unreliability was mitigated when it was complemented with expert review to give the final verdict.

              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                When we encounter future opposing idea challenges, we no longer view weaknesses and constraints as
                limitations to our solution but a springboard to innovation. With integrative thinking, we can use
                structured thinking models to explore deep thinking avenues that guide us toward integrating our two
                opposing ideas into a stronger and more resilient solution.

              A key theme that emerged during this phase of our project was the importance of continuous user feedback
              in shaping a user-centered product. When we sought feedback on our high-fidelity prototypes, it quickly
              became apparent that our designs had various usability gaps. One screen, for example, only had a single
              “agree” button without clearly indicating which suggestion it referred to. This ambiguity could have
              been
              easily caught earlier, had we involved users consistently throughout.

            <div class="expanded-content" style="display: none;">
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Reflecting on this, we recognized a major oversight in our process: we had skipped user feedback
                during
                the transition from mid-fi to high-fi, assuming that our design choices were sufficient. This
                complacency led us to rely on internal assumptions rather than real user needs. As a result, what
                seemed
                like obvious flaws in hindsight were completely missed until much later.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                This experience taught us that user feedback is not a one-time checkbox, but a vital and ongoing part
                of
                the design process. By neglecting it, we risked drifting away from user needs and investing time in
                refining ideas that did not fully capture the essence of our solution. In future projects, we are
                committed to embedding user testing into every stage, not just to validate our work, but to inform
                continuously. This approach will help us catch issues earlier, adapt more effectively, and stay
                aligned
                with real-world use cases.

              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                We learned to observe not just what users did, but how they felt doing it. Facial expressions, sighs
                of frustration, and moments of confusion were as valuable as click data. One participant's comment -
                "I feel stupid using this" - completely changed how we approached error messaging and help text.
                We realized that poor usability doesn't just waste time; it makes people feel bad about themselves.

              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Ultimately, this experience deepened our understanding of user feedback in design as a collaborative
                and
                iterative process. It reminded us that the best products are not designed in isolation, but in
                conversation with the people they are meant to serve.

              Another key learning point in our design journey emerged from continued user testing, specifically, how
              real user behaviour can challenge our initial assumptions. For the species identification feature, we
              initially designed a multi-step process: users would upload a
              photo, receive multiple AI-generated species suggestions based on confidence levels, and then select one
              to proceed to an information page. We believed that this would empower users to make more accurate
              selections and feel more in control.
            </p>
            <div class="expanded-content" style="display: none;">
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                However, user feedback revealed that this assumption was flawed. Users were not experts and in
                practice,
                most users simply selected the first option without evaluating the others, undermining the purpose of
                the feature. What we had thought was a helpful layer of precision ended up introducing friction and
                unnecessarily complicating the experience.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                In response, we removed the species suggestion step entirely and streamlined the user flow to lead
                directly from photo upload to the animal’s information page. This change better matched user
                expectations and behaviour, reducing confusion and making the process more efficient.

              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                This experience reinforced a critical insight: our assumptions, no matter how logical, must be
                validated
                through actual user testing. There’s often a gulf between how designers imagine a feature will be used
                and how users actually interact with it. Assumptions should not be treated as truths, but as
                hypotheses
                that need testing.

              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                User testing also helped us uncover edge cases and overlooked scenarios, particularly from the
                expert’s
                perspective. We assumed that the expert would want to log every image sourced from iNaturalist,
                believing that all data is valuable. However, feedback highlighted that some images might be of poor
                quality or irrelevant, making them unsuitable for logging. Yet, our interface had no option for the
                expert to skip or ignore such entries, an oversight on our part.

              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                This revealed the importance of designing for flexibility and real-world context, not just the ideal
                use
                case. By failing to consider exceptions, we risked frustrating users and forcing them into decisions
                that didn’t align with their goals.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Overall, these experiences have taught us that user testing is not only about validation but also
                discovery. It reveals gaps, surfaces unexpected needs, and pushes us to let go of assumptions in
                favour
                of real user needs. Moving forward, we are committed to grounding our design decisions in actual user
                behaviour, not just theoretical logic, and ensuring that our solutions are shaped by the people who
                use
                them.
