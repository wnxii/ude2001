                Throughout this project, I've experienced significant growth in both technical skills and collaborative
                abilities. Working on Botaniq challenged me to think beyond traditional UX patterns and consider the
                unique needs of citizen scientists and environmental researchers.
              </p>
              <div class="expanded-content" style="display: none;">
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The most valuable lesson was learning to balance user needs with technical constraints. Initially, I
                  focused heavily on feature-rich interfaces, but user testing revealed that simplicity and clarity were
                  far
                  more important for our target audience.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  One of the most challenging aspects was learning to let go of preconceived notions about what users
                  wanted.
                  I had to develop humility and accept that my assumptions were often wrong. This shift in mindset was
                  uncomfortable at first but ultimately liberating.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The project also taught me the importance of cross-functional collaboration. Working closely with
                  developers,
                  researchers, and domain experts expanded my perspective and improved the quality of our solutions. I
                  learned
                  to communicate design decisions more effectively and to incorporate technical constraints into my
                  design process
                  from the beginning rather than treating them as afterthoughts.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Perhaps most importantly, I developed confidence in my ability to tackle complex, ambiguous problems.
                  The Botaniq project had no clear precedent, which forced me to think creatively and develop novel
                  approaches.
                  This experience has prepared me to take on more challenging design problems in the future.

                This project significantly enhanced my prototyping and user research skills. Learning to conduct
                effective
                user interviews and synthesize findings into actionable design decisions was particularly valuable.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  I also developed a deeper appreciation for accessibility and inclusive design. Designing for diverse
                  user
                  groups, including those with varying levels of botanical knowledge, taught me the importance of
                  progressive disclosure and contextual help.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The research phase was particularly transformative. I learned to ask better questions, to listen more
                  carefully, and to identify patterns across different user interviews. The process of creating personas
                  and user journey maps became much more meaningful when grounded in real user data rather than
                  assumptions.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  My prototyping skills evolved from creating static mockups to building interactive prototypes that
                  could
                  effectively communicate complex interactions. Learning to use tools like Figma more effectively and
                  understanding when to use different fidelities of prototypes was crucial for getting meaningful
                  feedback
                  from stakeholders and users.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  I also gained experience in facilitating design workshops and collaborative sessions. Learning to

                  discussions, manage different personalities, and synthesize diverse viewpoints into actionable
                  insights
                  was a valuable skill that extends beyond design work.

              My design philosophy has evolved from aesthetic-focused to user-centered. Before this project, I often
              prioritized visual appeal over functionality. Working on Botaniq taught me that great design is invisible
              –
              it enables users to accomplish their goals without friction.

                I've also learned to embrace iterative design. The multiple rounds of prototyping and testing showed me

                This shift required unlearning some habits I had developed. I used to become attached to my first ideas
                and defend them vigorously. Now I understand that design is about solving problems, not showcasing
                creativity. The best designs often feel obvious in hindsight, which means they're doing their job well.

                was one of many confusions about the premise of the problem. Due to the open-ended nature of the
                problem statement that lacked specific constraints, there were a broad range of interpretations about
                the premise and context of the problem. There were many questions that we wanted to ask, but we were
                unsure if our questions were able to target all the different user needs and perspectives. We learnt
                that when tackling an open-ended problem, there are too many viewpoints to take into consideration and
                we needed a way to consolidate them.

                interactions, objects and users, which gave us a comprehensive overview of gaps in our questions. This
                allowed the questions we crafted to have a more holistic view to uncover various users and their
                needs. We learnt the importance of having a shared mental model within our group to align our goals

              During our ideation phase, there was a divide within our group about the use of AI to automate the process
              as opposed to a human expert identifier. Our partner in the project made it clear that while AI can be
              helpful, it may be unreliable and so she discourages the use of it. This brought to light two opposing
              perspectives: one advocating for AI-led identification to leverage speed and scalability, and the other
              emphasizing the importance of expert judgement to ensure accuracy and trustworthiness. This clash of ideas
              forced us to grapple with the limitations and strengths of both approaches, having to choose one or the
              other.

                To move forward, we applied integrative thinking. Rather than choosing one side, we faced the tension of
                opposing ideas to generate a creative solution that contains elements of the opposing ideas but is
                superior to simply using one. We identified the pros of each idea and identified the central tension of
                “How can we use both AI and human expertise without compromising reliability or efficiency?”

              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Our breakthrough came when we proposed a system where the AI suggests a species, but the expert makes
                the final call. This approach allowed us to retain the reliability of the expert, while still benefiting
                from AI’s speed and consistency. By embracing the tension instead of avoiding it, we created a more
                resilient and well-rounded solution.

              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                This experience taught us several important lessons. First, conflicting ideas are not roadblocks but
                opportunities for creative resolution. Disagreements can lead to stronger, more innovative outcomes when
                explored thoughtfully. Second, decision-making models such as integrative thinking help push us beyond
                surface-level comparisons. They encourage deeper analysis and structured reasoning, which ultimately
                guided our team to a consensus. Lastly, we learnt that limitations like AI’s occasional inaccuracy can
                be reframed as creative constraints that drive better design. In our case, AI’s weakness of
                unreliability was mitigated when it was complemented with expert review to give the final verdict.

              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                When we encounter future opposing idea challenges, we no longer view weaknesses and constraints as
                limitations to our solution but a springboard to innovation. With integrative thinking, we can use
                structured thinking models to explore deep thinking avenues that guide us toward integrating our two
                opposing ideas into a stronger and more resilient solution.

              A key theme that emerged during this phase of our project was the importance of continuous user feedback
              in shaping a user-centered product. When we sought feedback on our high-fidelity prototypes, it quickly
              became apparent that our designs had various usability gaps. One screen, for example, only had a single
              “agree” button without clearly indicating which suggestion it referred to. This ambiguity could have been
              easily caught earlier, had we involved users consistently throughout.

            <div class="expanded-content" style="display: none;">
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Reflecting on this, we recognized a major oversight in our process: we had skipped user feedback during
                the transition from mid-fi to high-fi, assuming that our design choices were sufficient. This
                complacency led us to rely on internal assumptions rather than real user needs. As a result, what seemed
                like obvious flaws in hindsight were completely missed until much later.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                This experience taught us that user feedback is not a one-time checkbox, but a vital and ongoing part of
                the design process. By neglecting it, we risked drifting away from user needs and investing time in
                refining ideas that did not fully capture the essence of our solution. In future projects, we are
                committed to embedding user testing into every stage, not just to validate our work, but to inform
                continuously. This approach will help us catch issues earlier, adapt more effectively, and stay aligned
                with real-world use cases.

              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                We learned to observe not just what users did, but how they felt doing it. Facial expressions, sighs
                of frustration, and moments of confusion were as valuable as click data. One participant's comment -
                "I feel stupid using this" - completely changed how we approached error messaging and help text.
                We realized that poor usability doesn't just waste time; it makes people feel bad about themselves.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Ultimately, this experience deepened our understanding of user feedback in design as a collaborative and
                iterative process. It reminded us that the best products are not designed in isolation, but in
                conversation with the people they are meant to serve.

              Another key learning point in our design journey emerged from continued user testing, specifically, how
              real user behaviour can challenge our initial assumptions. For the species identification feature, we
              initially designed a multi-step process: users would upload a
              photo, receive multiple AI-generated species suggestions based on confidence levels, and then select one
              to proceed to an information page. We believed that this would empower users to make more accurate
              selections and feel more in control.
            </p>
            <div class="expanded-content" style="display: none;">
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                However, user feedback revealed that this assumption was flawed. Users were not experts and in practice,
                most users simply selected the first option without evaluating the others, undermining the purpose of
                the feature. What we had thought was a helpful layer of precision ended up introducing friction and
                unnecessarily complicating the experience.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                In response, we removed the species suggestion step entirely and streamlined the user flow to lead
                directly from photo upload to the animal’s information page. This change better matched user
                expectations and behaviour, reducing confusion and making the process more efficient.

              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                This experience reinforced a critical insight: our assumptions, no matter how logical, must be validated
                through actual user testing. There’s often a gulf between how designers imagine a feature will be used
                and how users actually interact with it. Assumptions should not be treated as truths, but as hypotheses
                that need testing.

              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                User testing also helped us uncover edge cases and overlooked scenarios, particularly from the expert’s
                perspective. We assumed that the expert would want to log every image sourced from iNaturalist,
                believing that all data is valuable. However, feedback highlighted that some images might be of poor
                quality or irrelevant, making them unsuitable for logging. Yet, our interface had no option for the
                expert to skip or ignore such entries, an oversight on our part.

              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                This revealed the importance of designing for flexibility and real-world context, not just the ideal use
                case. By failing to consider exceptions, we risked frustrating users and forcing them into decisions
                that didn’t align with their goals.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Overall, these experiences have taught us that user testing is not only about validation but also
                discovery. It reveals gaps, surfaces unexpected needs, and pushes us to let go of assumptions in favour
                of real user needs. Moving forward, we are committed to grounding our design decisions in actual user
                behaviour, not just theoretical logic, and ensuring that our solutions are shaped by the people who use
                them.
